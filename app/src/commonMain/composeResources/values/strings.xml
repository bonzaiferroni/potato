        <item>You turn around and find yourself in a very strange place. It reminds you of the moment between a dream and wakefulness, where you can be aware of the events of either world. Nothing here has a definite shape, as if it can't quite commit on what shape to be.</item>
        <item>Parts of the dream flash around you in no particular order, sensations and feelings, each fading in, each fading out. And you are aware of time flowing more coherently, somewhere nearby.</item>
        <item>You can't remember anything before this place. You sift through your thoughts, holding each one for as long as you want to, like a stack of old game cards. Your thoughts begin to shape the dream.</item>
