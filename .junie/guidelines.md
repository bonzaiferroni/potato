## Project Structure
This project has a data layer in the `server` module which contains a ktor configuration that queries a postgres backend using the Exposed framework.

The domain layer can be found in the `model` module. It contains all the data classes that are used by the API. 

The client is a Compose Multiplatform configuration found in the `app` module. 

Documentation and notes can be found the `docs` folder.

## Game Structure
The core object of the game simulation is the GameEngine type which implements the Game interface. This object stores and initializes all the game data such as entities and zones and iterates the simulation using the update function.

The game is structured to have zones implemented by the GameZone class that represent areas where entities can interact. Entities are game objects and characters. Each entity has state that is modified and observed across game ticks. It may also have components which allow certain common functionality that modifies state to be reused between entity types. An entity's state data object might implement interfaces that define an aspect of entity state. 

All entity types extend StateEntity<T> where T extends the EntityState interface. StateEntity<T>.state is a read-only property of type T that provides the entity's state. 

For example, the Sprite entity extends StateEntity<SpriteState>. SpriteState extends a number of interfaces that inherit from EntityState. For example, it extends TargetState which defines a property of `var targetId: Long?`. This interface provides the bases for targeting among all the entities of the game. It has the component Rester which interacts with a `StateEntity<TargetState>`. Rester defines resting behavior which an entity can follow when its Spirit is low, and it is not otherwise engaged. The Rester component is active when `state.intent` evaluates to `Intent.Rest`. `State.intent` is how components coordinate control over the entity. 

## Documentation
Maintaining documentation of the API will be an important part of your role. Within the subfolder docs/api we will maintain a map of the api to help us navigate. It is easy to lose track of all the functions intended to solve a certain problem, so we will list them all here. For example, Game.md is where we will describe the API for the Game interface and all the associated functions.
